Running locally

For IOS

Do this first time + any time you change anything at the native level

## Setup

Add the google-services.json and GoogleService-Info.plist files from firebase

Running
We need this because firebase has been included. Everytime there is a change to package.json, you need to rerun these commands

```
npx expo run:ios
npx expo run:android
```

Starting the app

```
npm start
```
